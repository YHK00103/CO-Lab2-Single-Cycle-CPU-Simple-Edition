# CO-Lab2-Single-Cycle-CPU-Simple-Edition

## Goal
Utilizing the ALU in Lab1 to implement a simple single cycle CPU (Not required. See
Appendix.). CPU is the most important unit in computer system.

## Lab Requirement
1. Instruction set: the following instructions have to be executable in your CPU
design, and we will use some hidden cases to further evaluate your design.
